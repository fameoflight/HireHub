      HireHub is simple recruiter friendly way to online candidate screening.
      Currently finding good candidate is very difficult problem. A typical company
      get 10 - 100 candidate for every position they advertise. That causes lots of
      inefficiency. We want to fix this. We want companies to hire the best talent and
      make there process efficient.At the same time we love developers, we want to serve
      as educational platform for developers to contribute with there knowledge and learn
      from there peers. A platform where developers can hang out and solve interesting problems
      and have fun doing so.
